<h1>Treehouse Techdegree Project 2:</h1>
<h2>Pagination & Content Filter</h2>

<p>The opject of this project was to take some existing HTML/CSS and add a JavaScript file to the project that would allow for dynamic page changes without affecting the underlying HTML/CSS. This is done so that older browsers without updated JS can still view the content, albeit with a lesser experience.</p>
<p>This project was developed based on sourcecode by Rob Sherman</p>
